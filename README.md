Template for the project 2023 Winter
Your project infomration and assigment https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NB0rCDMe5Ua_KcNPXDjWTwBU49EI74RehVgfxSBVoNg/edit?usp=sharing

Your project should be split into 2 folders:
- Backend 
- Frontend

Each folder should have their own JS projects, so both of them will be have their own package.json, node_modules, .gitignore files etc. 

The respository should include exact steps how to run your project. 
Also we need to be able to run the project on our systems. So please tests that you have all dependencies added to your package.json files and commited.

Don't forget to:
- Run some prettier on your code 
- Clean this readme before you submit your project
